TG Jones being a new customer to OpenText will need their own MS contract, this is something that was central to discussions and has also been written into the contract in clause 11. This means that we will not go live with the solution if no service agreement is in place, eliminating the risk for us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Mike\u2019s MM team will pick up the opportunity on the new contract with TG Jones, we are in a strong position as we are the only option for them, timelines are tight with a clear deadline (14th November cutover weekend as per TSA) and the build already committed. We are currently waiting for WH Smith to share who the procurement stakeholder will be for the negotiation of the new TG Jones agreement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Let me know if you have any further questions on this topic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Best,&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: black;\">Owen&nbsp;</span></p>",
